# Vipps Recurring API

This repository contains developer resources for the Vipps Recurring API. This API is now offically launched.
For more information about this product, please see
[Vipps på Nett](https://www.vipps.no/bedrift/vipps-pa-nett).

**IMPORTANT:** Integration Access is available for existing customers that have
"Vipps på Nett" and a direct integration with the
[Vipps eCom API](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-ecom-api).

However since Vipps Recurring places some demands on merchant side functionality we have a checklist that all merchants
are required to review before getting production access. This is because we want to ensure that our user experience is
maintained.

Please review our [checklist](https://github.com/vippsas/vipps-recurring-api/blob/master/vipps-recurring-api-checklist.md).

To get full access, once you are ready, please
